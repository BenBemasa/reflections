When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  When you are working remotely (i.e. not with the computer having the local
  copy of the repository)
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When using a public account on Git this allows to have onyl version that
    are "distributable" posted on the Git account.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - Fork: allows to create your own new version (through new commits) of an existing
    repository for which you may not ave the authorization to cahnge the current version

    - Clone: makes a local copy of a repository on GitHub.

    - Branches: zllows to explore different variation of a runing verison of the code. 
    Can be used to expiriment new functionalities or to optimized the code. However, 
    requires you have been granted the authorizaiton to update the current code (not 
    necessarilly the case for "fork").

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It allows to track whether some chqnges hqve been mqde to the repositary while 
    working offline. This copy helps identifying conflict when a file is pulled from 
    GitHub.
