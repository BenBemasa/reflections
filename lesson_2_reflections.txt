What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A hidden folder .git is created which will store the information related to the 
	repository and the commits. It is needed to create the .gilt folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It allows a better control on the changes we want to be committed.
